# craft-account-sync
A plugin to sync a users minecraft account with our webapp.
This will allow for us to have all UUIDs, Keplr Addresses, and DiscordIDs in 1 place easy to query.

Should this plugin stop a user from doing anything if they have not synced yet?
(Allow them to move, but on any command prompt them to sync. Disable chat for them as well?)
